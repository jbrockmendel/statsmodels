	This is similar to np.atleast_2d.  The key difference is where the new
	dimension is inserted.  If a 1-dimensional array is passed to np.atleast_2d,
	the result will have 1 row that matches the original input.  If the same
	array is passed to atleast_2dcols, the result will have 1 column that
	matches the original input.
